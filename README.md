# This project demonstrates the principles of Clean Architecture as part of a presentation. 
Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to maintain, test, and scale. 
The project is organized to showcase how to structure code in a way that each layer is independent of the other, focusing on use cases and entities that are core to the application.
